                <p>I'm a digital designer who loves keeping things simple and organized, both in my work and in life. I truly believe that less is more. And I believe that the most important thing in designing is to create user-friendly products which are both useful and eye-pleasing.</p>

                <p>When I'm not busy designing, you'll probably find me outdoors. I love skiing, hiking, and traveling to new places. Exploring different cultures is one of my biggest passionsâ€”it sparks endless inspiration for my work and helps me see the world from fresh perspectives.</p>

                <p>I also can't imagine life without learning new things. I always keep myself busy learning new design skills, languages, or randomly googling how to build an airplane. For me, growth and creativity go hand in hand, and I love pushing myself to explore what's next.</p>

                <p>Right now, I'm also the Vice President of the Ukrainian Club at Hunter College. It's an incredible opportunity to share Ukrainian diverse culture through social media and events that we organize for students. I love getting people together in our community and exploring everything about Ukraine together.</p>

                <p>Take a look around my portfolio! I'm all about creating designs that feel effortless and meaningful. If you share my love for simplicity, curiosity, and adventure, let's connect!</p>
