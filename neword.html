      <p1>Role:</p1>      
<p>
            <strong>Researching | UX/UI design | Web Development</strong><br>
        </p>
        
      <p1>Project Background:</p1>
        <p>
            The initial concept for this project was a currency converter. However, due to challenges in integrating the selected API, the project pivoted to a language-learning website. The new concept focuses on helping users learn new vocabulary by introducing a "Word of the Day" feature, available in both English and Spanish. The website aims to provide an interactive, distraction-free environment for users to enhance their language skills.
        </p>

              <p1>Goal:</p1>

        <p>
            Create a simple and intuitive platform using an API where users can learn a new word each day in English or Spanish, enjoy a seamless and distraction-free experience, choose between dark and light themes to suit their preferences.
        </p>

              <p1>User Research:</p1>

        <p>
            Through research, it was clear that many language-learning websites are either overly complicated or lack essential features. The main goal was to design a simple, effective platform that prioritizes usability.

    <p1>Process:</p1>
    <p>
        With limited time to complete the project, the focus was on ensuring core functionality and usability.</p>

<p>Prototyping: Started with a low-fidelity prototype to map out the basic structure of the website, focusing on essential elements like the word randomizer, theme toggles, and language selection.</p>

<p>API Integration: Two APIs were selected for retrieving words in English and Spanish. The integration was implemented using AJAX in JavaScript, enabling seamless communication with the APIs without requiring full page reloads. This was the developer’s first experience working with APIs, and they successfully implemented the functionality through research and practice.</p>

<p>Design Decisions: Kept the layout minimalistic to avoid distractions. Hover effects were added to buttons and links to guide users intuitively through the interface.</p>

<p>Theme Toggle: Incorporated a dark/light mode toggle to enhance user comfort and accessibility.</p>

<p>Functionality: Added a randomizer that dynamically displays a new word each time the user presses the button. Separate interfaces were designed for English and Spanish word retrieval, with AJAX ensuring smooth updates when fetching new words.</p>

<p>During the implementation phase, challenges arose due to limited experience with JavaScript and AJAX. However, step-by-step learning, combined with lecture materials and practice, enabled the successful completion of the project.
