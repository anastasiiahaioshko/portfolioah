      <p1>Project Background:</p1>
        <p>
            Ukrainian Trampoline Gym wanted a website with all necessary information about prices, teachers, types of training, and location. The goal was to keep everything clean, logical, and easy to navigate without overwhelming users.
        </p>

              <p1>Goal:</p1>

        <p>
            Create a website that is simple, intuitive, and user-friendly while providing all the required information in a visually appealing way.
        </p>

              <p1>User Research:</p1>

        <p>
            After researching other trampoline gym websites in Lviv, I found that most were either too cluttered or lacked critical information. My goal was to ensure the redesign provided all key details while maintaining a clean design that was easy to navigate.

    <p1>Process:</p1>
    <p>
        Given a one-week timeline to complete the design, I began by creating a comprehensive list of essential elements to include. Once I had identified the priorities, I organized them into categories and developed a low-fidelity prototype to establish the structure and layout.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the initial prototyping phase, I recognized an opportunity to enhance the user experience by adding more detailed information about the teachers, such as their background and expertise, rather than limiting it to just names and pictures. With this insight, I moved on to creating the high-fidelity prototype.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initially, I incorporated pictures of the teachers with dynamic elements like jumps, but later refined the design by replacing these visuals with the brand's illustrations. This adjustment not only aligned better with the brand's identity but also resulted in a cleaner and more cohesive look for the landing page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon completing the final prototype, I submitted it to the client for review. The client was satisfied with the design as delivered, and no further revisions were requested.
